{"year":2021,"no":12,"subject":"english","question":"Situation : Read the news article. (1) Fabien Cousteau, a well-known ocean explorer, has announced plans to build a large research station under the ocean. The goal of the project is to become an \"underwater version of the International Space Station\" (ISS). He feels that though oceans cover more than 70% of our planet, they still aren't well explored. (2) Mr. Cousteau believes exploring the ocean is far more important than exploring space. Although the ocean is all around us, studying it is a challenge. Divers are limited in how far down they can go and how long they can stay below. Returning to the surface can be dangerous. After a deep dive, divers must wait for hours before they dive again. All of this means that undersea experiments are very limited. (3) Mr. Coustcau says that the research base won't just be used to study and help protect the sea, but also to research new ways of creating energy, growing food, and perhaps even scarching for new medicines. He hopes to have the lab completed and ready to use by 2023. According to the news article, which sentence is True about the undersea","a":"It will be mainly used for growing food.","b":"It was nearly complete at the time the article was written.","c":"It is designed only to conduct scientific and space research.","d":"It will study a variety of areas such as energy, food and medicines.","e":"","answer":"d"}

{"year":2021,"no":18,"subject":"english","question":"Situation: Read about a superstition. The hearse, the funeral car carrying a dead person. is a most well-known icon of death and mourning. Since the time of horse drawn hearses, a common belief was that if you saw a hearsc, you would be the next to die. To avoid such a horrible curse, in Victorian England, it was believed that holding a button could push away the death.  Some people held a button until they saw a bird. Others would go as far as to hold their breath, close their eyes and put their feet up in the air. One of the more interesting traditions about hearses passing by is taken from Japanese culture. Hiding one's thumb in a fist while the hearse passed was done to protect the parents from an early death. Another superstition is based on which direction you see the hearse moving. If the hearse is moving toward you and empty, it is considered good luck in some parts of the United States. In other areas of the U.S., it could bring on three days of good or bad luck. On the other hand, if a hearse is empty and moving away from you, you are close to death.

That's what the percgrine falcon does when it hunts. The peregrine falcon is built for fast flight. It has pointed, streamlined wings with powerful flight muscles. It also has a very strong heart and lungs. When it spots a bird in fight, it descends in a spectacular dive called a stoop, striking the prey with its claws. Those in the Arctic fly to South America in winter. When the weather warms, they return to the Arctic. This round-trip migration is 15,000 miles.

Peregrine falcons provide a great example of how humans can hurt nature. In the 1950's and 1960's human use of insect-killing pesticides like DDT made peregrine falcons an endangered species in the United States. The poisons got into the falcons' prey.
